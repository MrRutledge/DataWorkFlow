# **Seattle Bridge Data Work Flow**
Youtube follow along course by Jake Vanderplas **2/03/2018**

In this project I reproduce a data analysis of the Seattle Fremont Bridge data, the data we analyse is collected using the  automated bicycle counter.

More indepth background about the project can be found on Jakes's [__blog__](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYCpMb24GpOC704uO9svUrihl-HY1tTJJ).

I tried it first by following his tutorial on youtube, but I later found out that this toturial is best consumed by reading the [__blog__](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/) first and then following it using the medium of your choice for practice.

But if you wish to view my version of it, you can follow along by clicking this [__notebook.__](https://github.com/MrRutledge/Seattle_Bridge_Data_work_flow/blob/master/Seattle_Bridge_Bike_Data.ipynb) 
I have made the notebook as accessble as possible because I myself am just learning. 

### **The project**

Apart from the visible files the project has one main folder in it, the jupyterworkflow folder contains the data files, test files etc.

In order to run this project you can just clone in your local repo.
