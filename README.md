# ** Seattle Bridge Data Work Flow**
Youtube follow along course by Jake Vanderplas **2/03/2018**

In this project I reproduce a data analysis of the Seattle Fremont Bridge data, the data we analyse is collected using the  automated bicycle counter.

More indepth back ground about the project can be found on Jakes's [__blog__](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYCpMb24GpOC704uO9svUrihl-HY1tTJJ).

I tried it first by following his tutorial on youtube, but I later found out that this toturial is best consumed by reading the [__blog__](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/) first and then following it using the medium of your choice for practice.
